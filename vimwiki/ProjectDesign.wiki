= Day 1 =
== Takeaways ==
=== Effort estimation ===
Effort estimation by at least 6 to 9 people
Result within one standard deviation
=== Critical path and floats ===
 * Plan according to minimal float.
 * Plan for minimal staffing that does not affect critical path.
 * Graph can vary depending on the available staffing. (Only one developer, so one string of pearls)

=== Staffing Distribution Chart ===
lying amphora

=== Project Efficiency ===
Effort / (Elapsed time including vacation, weekends)

=== Earned Value Planning ===

= Questions =
 * What about vacation
   # No absolute clear answer, will try to figure it out if someone is away for long, then plan for it (honeymoon)
 * Why 30 days -> margin in cost? Risk reduction? 
   # Will give person months to then calculate the cost. 
 * What about activities that do not require 100% resources PM, PO, CM(configuration manager responsible for CI, Builds, ...) (improve efficiency and satisfaction)
   # take it into account within staffing
   # also check that if resources that are more expensive this has to be accounted for in the cost calculation

= Excel =
 * solve for (get a value that if applied results in x)
 * trendline to get a formula for the curve

= Project Risk =
 * opt for 50%
 * don't go over 75%
 * don't go under 30%
 * risk is similar to richter scala or russian rulet

= Ideas =
 * Sort by start, total slack, duration(descending) for assigning the resources
 * Layers of resistance https://education.biu.ac.il/sites/education/files/shared/layers-of-resistance.pdf
 * Create a column with activity dependencies and copy the predecessors to that column, then the resource dependencies are documented automatically
 * Assign all resources that are clear architect, test engineer
 * Assign Dev1 to critical path
 * Assign Dev2 with float
 * Assign remaining developers
 * After every step hide the assigned resources
 * MS Project add-on project design
 * For every solution (developers) start from scratch
   # create a template from the ms project with the architects and test engineers etc. allocated   

= Cocomo = 
Estimation tool

# spectral risk measurement

= Books =
  * Think fast and slow daniel kahneman
  * The design of design 
  * antifragile (nassim nicholas taleb)
  * critical path metrices
  * the 7 habits of highly effective people
  * getting things done https://store.gettingthingsdone.com
  * Never split differences negotiating depended
  * applied software measurement analysis productivity
  * estimating software cost bringing realism
  * quantifying software global insustry perspectives ebook
  

= Presentation =
  * check that you aren't using filler words
  * don't say sorry say thank you (for your patience)

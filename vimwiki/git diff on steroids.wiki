= git diff on steroids =


== Summary ==

The settings and scripts in this folder dramatically extend the functionality of
`git diff`. It makes `git diff` usable for file formats like pdf, docx, xlsx
and more.

== Usage ==

1. extend your personal `~/.gitconfig` file with the settings from `.gitconfig`
2. add file `.gitattributes` at the top level of each git repository you want to
   improve `git diff`
3. add the script `unoconv-pdf-diff` somewhere in your PATH
4. install all or a subset of the following programs depending on which diff
   fitlers you want to use

    - diffpdf (http://www.qtrac.eu/diffpdf.html)
    - unoconv (http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv, needs libreoffice)
    - xlsx2csv (https://github.com/dilshod/xlsx2csv)
    - pandoc (http://pandoc.org)

== Hint == 

`git diff` supports highlighting changes on a word per word, instead of line by
line basis. This is achived by the command `diff --word-diff=color
--word-diff-regex='[A-z_]+|[^[:space:]]'`

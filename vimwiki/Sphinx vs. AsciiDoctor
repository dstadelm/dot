== Sphinx vs. AsciiDoctor ==

Admonitions:: Both support admonitions. *Sphinx* has a custom admonition whereas *AsciiDoctor* requires some hacking for custom admonitions

Includes:: Both support includes through their underlying language (RST, AsciiDoc), however *Sphinx* relative includes doe not always work and it is not clear due to what reason it sometime fails.

Images:: Both require the images to be in a specific image directory (Oh why, oh why)

Header Shift:: *AsciiDoctor* allows to shift the header when including a file, *Sphinx* does not support this.

Tables:: *AsciiDoctor* has more sophisticated tables but *Sphinx* has reasonable support.

Output::
:: *AsciiDoctor* focuses on print output (pdf, docbook, ePub, man) and can also generate html output, but all is on one page which isn't such a nice experience to navigate. For a more sophisticated web experience *Antora* exists, however it requires Web-Developer knowledge to configure the look and feel.
:: *Sphinx* / Docutils can create HTML, pdf via LaTeX, ePub, Texinfo, man pages.

Linking between Documents::
:: Works for both

Search:: only *Sphinx* provides a search bar

Wavedrom:: both support native wavedrom as input via extensions

Repository Rendering::
:: RST is rendered on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, but not on Bitbucket Server
:: AsciiDoc is rendered on GitHub and GitLab, possibly Bitbucket Cloud, but not on Bitbucket Server however there is a browser extension *AsciiDoctor*.js that allows to render the pages when switching to RAW and it handles includes correctly and renders wavedrom

== Conclusion ==
My impression is AsciiDoc is the better backend than RsT but Sphinx is the better easier frontend than e.g. Antora
